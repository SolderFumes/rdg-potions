# A (very) rudamentary python GUI application to help with brewing in RGD

In retrospect, this would've been 100000x easier as a webapp, but now I have a little more of an understanding of python GUI. Feel free to make this prettier if you feel inclined, I'll monitor pull requests.

# Installation Guide

1) Download the code as a ZIP file or clone it from the repository.

2) Unzip the file and navigate to the unzipped folder.

3) Run main.py!

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter an issue (particularly on Windows) where trying to double-click on main.py opens and closes a window:
  - Right click the background of the folder and choose **"Open In Terminal"**
  - run ```python main.py```
If Windows asks you what you want to open the file with, it's likely you do not have python installed:
  - Open the command prompt and type ```python```. Install python 3.x from the Microsoft Store.
